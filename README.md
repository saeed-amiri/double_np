# double_np
making systems for double nanoparticles
The scripts obtain the required residues and organize the input for Packmol.
To achieve this, the input must include the dimensions of the overall box containing both nanoparticles and the source files for each residue. The center point between the two nanoparticles will be set at coordinates (0 0 0).
